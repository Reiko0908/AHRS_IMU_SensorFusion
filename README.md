# AHRS_IMU_SensorFusion
This repository focuses on the sensor fusion algorithms combining data from IMU sensors to estimate attitude and heading using AHRS techniques. It leverages advanced filtering methods like Extended Kalman Filter and Madgwick Orientation Filter for accurate orientation estimation and real-time motion tracking.
